# Software
1. Raspberry Pi OS installed
2. Python 3

# Setup Instructions
Note: This is assuming you have installed Rasberry Pi and Python already
# Connect Motion Sensor,light, and resistor to the GPIO board
Below is a diagram of the connections needed to be made in order to connect all of the devices together.

# Start the Raspberry Pi and add the code
If you want to keep the email component you will need to add the specifics to the email in order for it to work. 
Once run the code should work properly.
